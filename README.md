#### PRAYER...A WHA DAT? (PRAYER... WHAT IS THAT?)

**SUMMARY OF SERMON BY REV. Dr. DAVE HAZLE ON SUNDAY 25 FEBRUARY 2024**

Yes, "ACTS" is a popular mnemonic that many Christians use to guide their prayer life, providing a structure that covers key components of prayer. It stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication. Here's a brief outline of each component:

1. **Adoration:**
- Begin your prayer by adoring God for who He is. Praise His attributes, such as His love, wisdom, power, and grace. This focuses your heart and mind on the greatness and majesty of God.

2. **Confession:**
- After adoring God, move to confessing your sins. This is a time to be honest and transparent before God about your failures, seeking His forgiveness and cleansing. Confession is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship with God, as it acknowledges our need for His mercy.

3. **Thanksgiving:**
- Thanksgiving involves expressing gratitude to God for His blessings and provisions in your life. This can include thanking Him for specific things He has done for you, as well as general expressions of gratitude for His constant presence and care.

4. **Supplication:**
- Finally, supplication is presenting your requests and needs to God. This can involve praying for yourself as well as interceding on behalf of others. It's a time to share your concerns, desires, and fears with God, trusting Him to work according to His will.

This structure is not a rigid formula that must be followed in every prayer, but rather a guide to help believers engage with God in a comprehensive and meaningful way. It ensures that prayer is not just about asking for things, but also about developing a deeper relationship with God through worship, confession, and thanksgiving.
